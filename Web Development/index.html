	 		<h1>Home Page</h1>
	 		<p>Dunoon is located on the Cowal peninsula in the west of Scotland overlooking the Firth of Clyde, in the county of Argyllshire, approximately 415 miles north-north-west of London and 39 miles south of Inveraray.</p>
	 		<p>Set against mountain scenery and sited around two bays, it is the largest town in Argyll and a popular resort and sailing centre. There are some notable historic buildings, including the remains of the 11th-century Dunoon Castle which stand on top of a hill affording superb views over the town. It is a good base from which to explore the Cowal, the Clyde, and the Highlands to the north.</p>
